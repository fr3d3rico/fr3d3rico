With ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white) Stack I have been using versions 8 and 11 to build rest services with ![Quarkus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Quarkus-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=quarkus) and Spring Boot. I develop legacy Servlet applications to use Quarkus and Spring Boot in the cloud. This evolution is already prepared to use services such as ![Redis](https://img.shields.io/badge/redis-%23DD0031.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=redis&logoColor=white) to gain performance and be deployed in ![Kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/kubernetes-%23326ce5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=kubernetes&logoColor=white) and ![Red Hat](https://img.shields.io/badge/Red%20Hat-EE0000?style=for-the-badge&logo=redhat&logoColor=white) Openshift.
I have advanced experience using ![Apache Kafka](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache%20Kafka-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=apachekafka), Kafka Connect, Kafka Streams and Redis Streams.
The main points of this stack were the experiences in creating cache services using Redis to increase performance. And using Kafka Streams to process data in asynchronous transactions.


With the Stack based on ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/c%23-%23239120.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white)  I have already worked on a project that built a Minimal API with ASP.NET Core together with ![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/angular-%23DD0031.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=angular&logoColor=white) and Chart.js.
The main points were token generation and validation on the backend, and use of Angular Guard on the frontend. ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) 10 and Angular 10 were used for private reasons to the client.


I already have initial experience in more specific deployments on ![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-%23FF9900.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white) services with EKS and ECS.

For testing I have used ![Selenium](https://img.shields.io/badge/-selenium-%43B02A?style=for-the-badge&logo=selenium&logoColor=white) + JUnit and JMeter a lot to see the performance of the applications.

I work a lot with the infrastructure team helping to create Containers (![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-%230db7ed.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white) / Podman) to help deploy to Openshift and Kubernetes. Creating endpoints for Readiness and Liveness.

And more recently, with my postgraduate degree in *Data Science and Analytics* in progress, I have been improving my experience with Python and specific libs for data exploration such as:

![Matplotlib](https://img.shields.io/badge/Matplotlib-%23ffffff.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Matplotlib&logoColor=black)
![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/numpy-%23013243.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=numpy&logoColor=white)
![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-%23150458.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=pandas&logoColor=white)
![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-%23F7931E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)
